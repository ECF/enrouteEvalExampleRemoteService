# enrouteEvalExampleRemoteService
This repo contains a copy of the OSGi enroute base 'eval' tutorial (located here http://enroute.osgi.org/tutorial_base/050-start.html ).  The code in these projects also turns the example into a remote service using ECF's implementation of Remote Service Admin see http://www.eclipse.org/ecf.
